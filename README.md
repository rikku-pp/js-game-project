# Patterns II

Patterns II is a pen&paper game originally created by Sid Sackson 📐✏

The online version does not differ much in how it is played, but can be significantly quicker and easier 🌟 since no hand drawing and manual reviewing is needed. 

## How to play

This glitch can only handle one game session at a time. If you get stuck facing the `Game in progress` message, you can set up a new game by hitting the Remix-button. 

 * When you see the `Welcome to Patterns II` screen, you are good to go. 
 * Checkout `HOW TO PLAY.MD` for more info about the rules of play.
